# Apache AGE Internship 2023 Coding Test Question-No.6 :Basic-Algos

This repository contains solutions to three JavaScript coding challenges: palindrome checking, finding a missing integer, and creating a digital clock.

## Question 6-1: Palindrome Checker

### Function Name: checkPalindrome()

This function takes input from the user and checks if it is a palindrome. If the input is not a palindrome, the function returns it in reverse order.

**Usage:**
1. Open the browser console or use any JavaScript environment.
2. Copy and paste the code from `Question 6-1.js`.
3. Call the `checkPalindrome()` function.

## Question 6-2: Finding a Missing Integer

### Function Name: checkMissing(arr)

This function finds a missing integer from an array of the first 45 numbers (with one missing number).

**Usage:**
1. Open the browser console or use any JavaScript environment.
2. Copy and paste the code from `Question 6-2.js`.
3. Create an array with the first 45 numbers and leave one number missing.
4. Call the `checkMissing(arr)` function with the array as an argument.

## Question 6-3: JavaScript Digital Clock

### Function Name: myDigitalClock()

This function creates a digital clock using JavaScript, displaying the current time in 12-hour format with AM/PM.

**Usage:**
1. Open the browser console or use any JavaScript environment.
2. Copy and paste the code from `Question 6-3.js`.
3. Call the `myDigitalClock()` function.

## How to Run the Code

To execute any of the JavaScript functions, follow these steps:

1. Open your preferred JavaScript environment, such as a browser console or a code editor with a JavaScript runtime.
2. Create a new JavaScript file or use the existing files: `Question 6-1.js`, `Question 6-2.js`, `Question 6-3.js`.
3. Copy and paste the relevant function into the JavaScript file.
4. Save the file.
5. Run the file in your JavaScript environment to see the output.
